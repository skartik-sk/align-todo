Full Stack – Campus Machine Round | UIT RGPV | 04-Feb-2026  
Project Overview:  You are required to build and deploy a fully functional web application within 75 minutes. This assignment tests your ability to work under time constraints, make quick technical decisions, and deliver a working product. 

Required Project: Todo Application with Authentication 
Build a Full-Stack Todo Application with Session Management 
You must build a complete todo application with the following mandatory features: 

 Core Features Required: 

1. Authentication & Session Management
User Registration: Sign up with email and password 
User Login: Secure login with email and password 
Session Management: 
Maintain user sessions using JWT tokens or server-side sessions 
Keep users logged in across page refreshes 
Session expiration after inactivity (configurable time) 
Logout: Clear session and redirect to login 
Protected Routes: Only authenticated users can access their todos 
Password Security: Hash passwords 
NO THIRD-PARTY AUTH SERVICES: You must implement authentication yourself (no Clerk, Auth0, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, or similar services) 

 2. Todo Management
Create Todo: Authenticated users can create new todos 
Title/Description (required) 
Status: Pending/Completed (default: Pending) 
Created timestamp (auto-generated) 
User association (auto-linked to logged-in user) 
View All Todos: Users see ONLY their own todos 
Update Todo: 
Edit todo text/description 
Mark todo as complete/incomplete (toggle status) 
Delete Todo: Remove todos permanently 
Filter Todos: Filter by status (All/Pending/Completed) 

 3. User Experience Features
Responsive Design: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop 
Loading States: Show loading indicators during API calls 
Error Handling: Display meaningful error messages 
Form Validation: Validate inputs before submission 
Empty States: Show appropriate messages when no todos exist 
Todo Counter: Display count of pending/completed todos 

 4. Authorization
Users can only view, edit, and delete their own todos 
Backend API must verify ownership before allowing any todo operations 
No user should be able to access another user's todos 

 Technical Requirements 
Frontend 
Framework/Library: React, Next.js, Vue, or Vanilla JavaScript 
Styling: Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or plain CSS 
Deployment: Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages 
Backend 
Runtime: Node.js (Express/Fastify) or Python (Flask/FastAPI) 
Deployment: Render, Railway, or Cyclic 
API: RESTful endpoints required 
Session Management 
Security: Password hashing required 
IMPORTANT: You MUST implement authentication yourself - NO third-party auth services (Clerk, Auth0, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, NextAuth.js, Passport.js with OAuth, etc.) 

Database 
Options: MongoDB (Atlas), TursoDB, Supabase (database only), PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Firebase (database only) 
Requirement: Must persist data (not in-memory storage) 
IMPORTANT: You can use Supabase or Firebase for database storage only, but NOT their authentication services 

Version Control 
Bonus: GitHub repository with clear README 
Bonus: Meaningful commit messages showing development progress
